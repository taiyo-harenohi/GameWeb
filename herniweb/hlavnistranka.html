        <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
        <h2>Who am I and what is this page about?</h2>
        <p class="odsazene sklonene">I would like to be known as Taiyo on this page and in my own work. The pseudonym comes from Japanese and it is a word for “sun”. The name of the production team, Hare no Hi, should mean something along the lines “The sun is rising”.  <br>                    <br>
I am a high schooler who is graduating next year. I love programming, writing and painting, so I tried to combine it and got as a result this – a lot of game projects to work on. To find out more about them, you can click on the page called “Production”. Or you can just look below to see all of the articles in one place! As of one, those projects are: Ocean Eyes, The Dream of a Boy and A Planet Called Moon.  <br> <br>
Except for all of those hobbies listed above, I like playing video games and I would like to start writing some reviews. I personally enjoy reading others’ opinions on certain products, it can help me to get a bigger picture. Plus, I enjoy indie games the most, so you can bet you can find some unknown titles in that section!   <br>     <br>
Later on, I was thinking about making courses about programming. As of now, I know basics of HTML, CSS and C#. I programmed for some time Visual Novels in Python, so I know a little bit about it, too. And last but not least, I have some experiences with JavaScript and C++, even though they aren’t big.       <br>        <br>
